The state mutation in your app needs to be describes as a pure function that takes previous state and the action being dispatch and returns next state.

Inside any redux application there is one particular function that takes the state of the whole application and the action that is dispatched and returns the new state.
Even in the large application there is still just a single function that manages how the next state is calculated based on the previous state and the action is dispatched.
